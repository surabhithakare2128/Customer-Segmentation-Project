# Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree 
# Customer Segmentation Project

## Introduction

This is a project for Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree. In this project, I identified a group of people who are the potential core target for a mailing company by analyzing the general population. 
 I used unsupervised learning algorithm (K-Means) to cluster customers into groups based on the purchasing data.

## Concepts explored in this project:

Unsupervised learning algorithms like K-Means Clustering and Gaussian Mixture Model Clustering
Feature Scaling
Dimensionality reduction using Principle Component Analysis
Outlier identification and removal
Silhouette scores

To view the project, open Identify_Customer_Segements.ipynb. To know the description of the features kindly refer the Data_Dictionary.md.
